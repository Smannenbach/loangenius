**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** 2026-01-20  
**Owner:** DevOps  
**Review Frequency:** Annual

---

## Purpose
Establish procedures for identifying, assessing, and remediating security vulnerabilities.

---

## Scope
All components of LoanGenius including:
- Application code
- Dependencies (npm packages)
- Infrastructure
- Integrations

---

## Vulnerability Sources

| Source | Method | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Dependencies | npm audit | Every build |
| Code | Code review | Every PR |
| Infrastructure | Platform scans | Continuous |
| External | Bug bounty/reports | As received |

---

## Scanning Requirements

### Automated Scanning
| Scan Type | Tool | Frequency | Gate |
|-----------|------|-----------|------|
| Dependency vulnerabilities | npm audit | Every build | High+ blocks |
| License compliance | npm license checker | Every build | Restricted blocks |
| Code quality | ESLint | Every build | Errors block |
| Secrets in code | Pattern scan | Every commit | Blocks merge |

### Manual Assessment
| Assessment | Frequency | Scope |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| ASVS self-assessment | Semi-annual | Full application |
| Penetration test | Annual | Production environment |
| Code security review | Quarterly | High-risk components |

---

## Severity Classification

| Severity | CVSS Score | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0 | Immediate exploitation risk |
| High | 7.0 - 8.9 | Significant risk |
| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 | Moderate risk |
| Low | 0.1 - 3.9 | Minimal risk |

---

## Remediation SLAs

| Severity | SLA | Escalation |
|----------|-----|------------|
| Critical | 24 hours | Immediate to lead |
| High | 7 days | Daily standup |
| Medium | 30 days | Sprint planning |
| Low | 90 days | Backlog |

### SLA Exceptions
- If no fix available: Document, monitor, compensating control
- If fix breaks functionality: Risk assessment, compensating control
- All exceptions require Admin approval

---

## Dependency Vulnerability Handling

### Process
1. Vulnerability detected by npm audit
2. Severity assessed
3. Fix availability checked
4. If fix available: Update dependency
5. If no fix: Assess risk, consider alternatives
6. Document decision
7. Verify fix doesn't break functionality
8. Deploy

### Update Strategy
| Update Type | Process |
|-------------|---------|
| Patch version | Auto-merge if tests pass |
| Minor version | PR with review |
| Major version | Thorough review + testing |

---

## Vulnerability Tracking

### Required Information
- Vulnerability ID (CVE if available)
- Affected component
- Severity
- Discovery date
- Remediation status
- Target remediation date
- Actual remediation date

### Tracking Location
- GitHub Issues with `security` label
- Or dedicated security tracker

---

## Reporting

### Internal Reporting
- Weekly: Critical/High open vulnerabilities
- Monthly: All vulnerability metrics
- Quarterly: Trend analysis

### Metrics
- Time to detect
- Time to remediate
- Open vulnerability count by severity
- SLA compliance rate

---

## Disclosure Handling

### External Reports
1. Acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. Triage and validate
3. Assign severity
4. Remediate per SLA
5. Notify reporter of fix
6. Credit reporter if appropriate

### Responsible Disclosure
- Do not disclose until fix available
- Coordinate with reporter
- Document timeline

---

## Compensating Controls

When immediate remediation is not possible:
- Document the vulnerability
- Implement compensating controls (e.g., WAF rule, additional monitoring)
- Set aggressive monitoring for exploitation attempts
- Schedule remediation
- Review regularly

---

## Compliance

### Related Standards
- OWASP Vulnerability Management
- CIS Control 7 (Continuous Vulnerability Management)
- SOC 2 CC5.3, CC7.1
